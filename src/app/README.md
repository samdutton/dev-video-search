# Search Google developer videos

This directory includes code for a sample app that uses the [shearch-me.herokuapp.com get](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dev-video-search/tree/master/src/get) API to search  transcripts and data from [Google Developers](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers), [Android Developers](https://www.youtube.com/user/androiddevelopers) and [Chrome Developers](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChromeDevelopers).

You can try it out at [simpl.info/s](http://simpl.info/s):

The [t directory](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dev-video-search/tree/master/src/app/t) has code for displaying readable transcripts: see the example at [simpl.info/s/t/?id=ngBy0H_q-GY,3i9WFgMuKHs](http://simpl.info/s/t/?id=ngBy0H_q-GY,3i9WFgMuKHs).
